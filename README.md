# RPEngine
A project to make a Raspberry Pi powered emulation box based around the PC Engine

A couple of weeks ago I was searching for some information about something, I can’t remember what, I went to PCEWorks website. If you don’t know PCEWorks they re-release Japanese software, mostly NEC stuff (hence the name). This mostly results in CD versions of PC Engine HuCard games.

Connected to this they had added a page for a project of theirs called the Mega Engine. This looked like a cool device which put a PC Engine and CD Drive into one svelt box (it looks a little like a Mac-mini in fact). Upon doing further research I found out it was just a Raspberry Pi running RetroArch which has recentlyish added limited CD support.

So I thought, well – could I just make a version of it that was open-source? It was mostly a glorified Pi case anyway, it would need space for the Pi, a laptop CD drive and some way to connect a joypad.
